# SSH-Reverse-Tunnel
Simple Script to Create a Reverse SSH Tunnel 

## Explanation
This is an old script I found buried on a hard drive. Figured I might as well release it.

It's been handy in the past for doing ad-hoc VPN stuff, when I didn't have the luxury of a VPN.

I toyed with re-writing it to be more clear.  I also toyed with re-writing it Go.  I couldn't be bothered right now.
